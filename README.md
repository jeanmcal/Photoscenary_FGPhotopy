# Photoscenary_FGPhotopy
Photoscenary.py is a Python program designed to generate and manipulate photoscenery tiles for the FlightGear Flight Simulator (FGFS). It downloads orthophotos from map servers (e.g., ArcGIS), processes them into tiles, and converts them to DDS or PNG format for use in FlightGear.
